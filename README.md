### BPE calculation (by Surya Hariharan)
       This was done using ISPY-2 data (specifically ID 100899). Used to calculate BPE by means of programming, and later comparing findings with official reports.

### Process
       1. In order to execute the program, first download the data 
*if using a different ID, update the paths as needed* 
       2. Run all the cells in contrast_enchan.ipynb
*please note any changes in the dimension of image (if using an outside dataset*
*identify the pre and post contrast correctly to get desired results*
