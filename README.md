### BPE calculation (by Surya Hariharan)
       This was done using ISPY-2 data (specifically ID 100899). Used to calculate BPE by means of programming, and later comparing findings with official reports.
       
       Most of the code is used up by the plotting of certain images we start out with/ end with. 

### Process
       1. In order to execute the program, first download the data 

       2. Run all the cells in contrast_enchan.ipynb

       3. Make sure you're following all the names of the vars (if incorrect the program will not run as intended)

*if using a different ID, update the paths as needed* 
*please note any changes in the dimension of image (if using an outside dataset*
*identify the pre and post contrast correctly to get desired results*
